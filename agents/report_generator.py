# This code defines a report generation agent that takes insights as input and formats them into a report string.
# The `generate_report` function constructs a report by prepending "Generated Report:" to the insights.
# The agent is created using `RunnableLambda`, allowing it to be used in a data processing pipeline.
# This agent can be used to generate a report based on insights generated from data analysis, which can be useful for decision-making and communication.
# The report can be further customized or extended based on specific requirements.
# The `report_agent` can be integrated into a larger data processing pipeline to automate the reporting process.
